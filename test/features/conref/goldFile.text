# Final Document

T[esting]{: id=testingSuffix} the reference of an ID within the same document.

[Genesis]{: .secret} was the name of an adequate product.

Why did I do all this? [I don't want to have to rewrite this thing, with multiple classes inline.]{: .class1 .class2} If it renders, that's [**A RELIEF**]{: key=value foo=bar}. By the way, have you ever seen [testing links](www.github.com) ?

I like it when I eat a bananas _whilst_ wearing a sweater!

Wait, did you say *bananas*? Yes!

Let's start pulling in blocks:

```javascript
console.log("Just another example...");
```
{: class="whatevs"}

Also, I had a question about these items:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
{: short='true'}

And another list, without an attribute

* 4
* 5
* 6


Here's a great, and final, paragraph.
{: .wonderful words=nonsense .delete}

Finished testing!
